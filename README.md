  ## Description
  This project prompts the user to build a team profile for their employees. The user can choose between "Manager", "Engineer", and "Intern" in order to build a profile for their employees.

  ## Installation
  You may fork the repo from my GitHub and run this project in Visual Studio Code.
  
  ## Usage
  1. Open your integrated terminal and verify that you are in the correct path.
  2. Run `npm start` and you will see a list of prompts.
  3. After you answer all of the prompts, an "Output" folder will be created on your left. Click that folder and open `team.html`. Follow that html page in to your browser and you will have your personalized team profile ready for you.
